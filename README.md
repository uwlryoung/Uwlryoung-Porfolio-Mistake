# Uwlryoung Portfolio

## Description
My porfolio page (uwlryoung)

[Horiseon Webpage](https://uwlryoung.github.io/uwlryoung-portfolio)

### Coding Changes Made
The initial homepage code was missing alt text for images, had redundant code, and a few other areas that needed to be fixed. Here are a list of changes: 
- Added alt text to all images (hero pic, pics in the main cards and aside)
- For each card, there was a unique class name. The cards were renamed to have the same class since all the proprties remainded the same in the CSS. 
- URL Link in the nav bar was fixed to go to the proper section
- Semantic tags were added (main, figure, nav, aside)
- CSS tags were re-arranged in a logical order
- Title given to the homepage
